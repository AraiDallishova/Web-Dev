    <h1>January Poem</h1>
    <p>
        
        Only the wrinkle<br>
of a disappearing squirrel<br>
breaks the snow stillness.<br>

The walker, swathed in wool,<br>
lowers toward the prints left<br>
by others, feet that lead to the village.<br>

There a clock stands in front of a closed shop,<br>
its hour not late, though the moon has come early<br>
to mirror the white coin of its frozen face.<br>
